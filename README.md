Affix is a home-based marketplace system that connects people who need home repairs with workers who can provide them. It is built with Python, Django, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, Bootstrap, Tailwind and Serializers. HomeFix allows users to post their repair requests, such as plumbing, electrical, carpentry, painting and more. Workers can browse the requests and bid on them with their price and availability. Users can review the bids and choose the best worker for their job. Affix also handles the payment and rating process between users and workers. HomeFix is a convenient and reliable platform that simplifies the home repair process and creates opportunities for workers.
